# IntoTheLimbo
This project was done for a Multimedia production course. It's still a work in progress, since I intend to use this project as my final work at my uni and later, hopefully, perfect it for other people to enjoy. 

It was made with various programs including AI. It lacks shound, which is one of the things on my to-do list.
